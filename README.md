# Smart Autonomous Truck Management Platform

A full-stack, AI-powered platform to manage and simulate autonomous shipping trucks. This system provides real-time fleet tracking, delivery and maintenance scheduling, live CARLA-based simulations, and intelligent object detection using YOLO.

Built with a modular microservices architecture and deployed on AWS, the platform bridges real-world fleet logistics with simulation and machine learning, providing a powerful tool for both operators and researchers.
