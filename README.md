# Intelligent Service Cloud Platform for Autonomous Shipping Trucks  
---

## 1. Introduction  

Autonomous shipping trucks represent an emerging technology that promises greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the logistics and transportation industry. However, leveraging the full potential of these vehicles requires a robust, cloud-based solution for managing real-time data, scheduling, and intelligent analytics. This document proposes an Intelligent Service Cloud Platform for autonomous shipping trucks, which combines scalable cloud architecture (AWS), AI-driven insights (object detection, predictive maintenance), and simulator-based testing (CARLA) into one cohesive system.  

### 1.1 Objective  

1. **Real-Time Tracking & Monitoring:**  
   - Provide continuous updates on vehicle location, speed, and sensor data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.  

2. **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure:**  
   - Employ AWS to ensure the platform can handle multiple trucks simultaneously, offering high availability and fault tolerance.  

3. **AI-Driven Analytics:**  
   - Integrate computer vision models (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN) for obstacle detection and incorporate predictive maintenance algorithms to detect anomalies in truck operations.  

4. **Simulator Integration:**  
   - Leverage CARLA or a comparable platform to test and validate both hardware and software under realistic driving conditions.  

5. **User-Centric Dashboards:**  
   - Offer an intuitive UI for various user roles (truck owners, dispatch staff, cloud admins) with real-time alerts, route planning, and system performance metrics.  

### 1.2 Expected Outcomes  

- Efficient Fleet Management: Improved delivery speed and reduced operational costs through optimal route planning and minimal downtime.  
- Improved Safety & Reliability: Enhanced safety through early anomaly detection and object recognition.  
- Scalable Multi-Truck Handling: Efficient handling of numerous trucks (real or simulated) without performance bottlenecks, supported by load-balancing and auto-scaling strategies.  
- Validated System through Simulation: Thorough testing in the CARLA environment to ensure real-world readiness and robustness of AI components.
