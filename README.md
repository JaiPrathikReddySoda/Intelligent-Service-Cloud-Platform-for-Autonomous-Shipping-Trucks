4. **Simulator Integration:**  
   - Leverage CARLA or a comparable platform to test and validate both hardware and software under realistic driving conditions.  

5. **User-Centric Dashboards:**  
   - Offer an intuitive UI for various user roles (truck owners, dispatch staff, cloud admins) with real-time alerts, route planning, and system performance metrics.  

### 1.2 Expected Outcomes  

- Efficient Fleet Management: Improved delivery speed and reduced operational costs through optimal route planning and minimal downtime.
