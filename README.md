# Intelligent Service Cloud Platform for Autonomous Shipping Trucks  
---

## 1. Introduction  

Autonomous shipping trucks represent an emerging technology that promises greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the logistics and transportation industry. However, leveraging the full potential of these vehicles requires a robust, cloud-based solution for managing real-time data, scheduling, and intelligent analytics. This document proposes an Intelligent Service Cloud Platform for autonomous shipping trucks, which combines scalable cloud architecture (AWS), AI-driven insights (object detection, predictive maintenance), and simulator-based testing (CARLA) into one cohesive system.  

### 1.1 Objective  

1. **Real-Time Tracking & Monitoring:**  
   - Provide continuous updates on vehicle location, speed, and sensor data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.  

2. **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure:**  
   - Employ AWS to ensure the platform can handle multiple trucks simultaneously, offering high availability and fault tolerance.  

3. **AI-Driven Analytics:**  
   - Integrate computer vision models (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN) for obstacle detection and incorporate predictive maintenance algorithms to detect anomalies in truck operations.  

4. **Simulator Integration:**  
   - Leverage CARLA or a comparable platform to test and validate both hardware and software under realistic driving conditions.  

5. **User-Centric Dashboards:**  
   - Offer an intuitive UI for various user roles (truck owners, dispatch staff, cloud admins) with real-time alerts, route planning, and system performance metrics.  

### 1.2 Expected Outcomes  

- Efficient Fleet Management: Improved delivery speed and reduced operational costs through optimal route planning and minimal downtime.  
- Improved Safety & Reliability: Enhanced safety through early anomaly detection and object recognition.  
- Scalable Multi-Truck Handling: Efficient handling of numerous trucks (real or simulated) without performance bottlenecks, supported by load-balancing and auto-scaling strategies.  
- Validated System through Simulation: Thorough testing in the CARLA environment to ensure real-world readiness and robustness of AI components.

## 2. System Requirements and Analysis  

### 2.1 Product Perspective  

The Intelligent Service Cloud Platform for Autonomous Shipping Trucks is designed as a comprehensive standalone solution, replacing fragmented fleet management systems traditionally used for truck monitoring, maintenance scheduling, and route planning. The platform is cloud-based, utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to enable real-time truck monitoring, intelligent predictive maintenance, efficient route optimization, and robust simulation capabilities via the CARLA Simulator.  
It seamlessly integrates with:  
- External IoT sensors on autonomous trucks  
- Real-time GPS and sensor data feeds  
- External APIs (weather, traffic)  

### 2.2 Product Functions  

The system provides the following high-level functions:  
- **Truck Monitoring & Tracking:** Real-time GPS tracking, telemetry monitoring, sensor data analysis, and video streaming.  
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Analysis of sensor and telemetry data to predict mechanical issues and enable proactive maintenance.  
- **Route Optimization & Scheduling:** Dynamic routing based on real-time conditions, weather, traffic data, and truck availability.  
- **Real-Time Object Detection & Safety Alerts:** Integration of AI models for object detection and real-time safety alerts.  
- **Simulation & Scenario Testing (CARLA Simulator):** Scenario-based testing to assess performance and ensure safety.  
- **Dashboard & User Management:** Real-time monitoring, alerts handling, user administration, and scenario management.  

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics  

- **Truck Owners:** Oversee assigned trucks, check status/telemetry, and receive alerts on urgent maintenance.  
- **Dispatch Personnel (Logistics):** Plan and schedule delivery routes, monitor fleet movement, and handle service incidents.  
- **Cloud Administrators:** Manage platform infrastructure, user roles, scaling policies, and AI model integration.  

### 2.4 Interface Requirements  

**User Interfaces:**  
- Web Portal/Dashboard: Provides role-specific views (owner vs. dispatcher vs. admin).  
- Mobile-Friendly UI: Ensures on-the-go monitoring and updates.  

**Software Interfaces:**  
- CARLA Simulator API: Manages simulated trucks and environment parameters.  
- External Traffic/Weather Feeds (if integrated): Provides data for route optimization and hazard warnings.  

**Hardware Interfaces:**  
- Truck Sensor Modules: Real or simulated devices sending telemetry over MQTT/REST.  
- Edge Devices: Local processing before cloud transfer.
